	<h1>Vaccination</h1>
	<p>
	Equitable access to safe and effective vaccines is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic,so it is hugely encouraging to see so many vaccines proving and going in to development.WHO is working tirelessly with parments to develop, manufacture and deploy safe and effective vaccines.
	</p>
	<p>
	Safe and effective vaccines are a game changing tool, but for the foreseeablefuture we must continue wearing masks, cleaning our band, ensuring good ventilation indoors, physically distancing and avoiding crowds.
	</p>
	<p>
	Being Vaccinated does not mean that we can throw caution to the wind and put ourselves and others at risk, particularlt because research is still ongoing into how much vaccines protect not only against disease but also against infection and transmission.
